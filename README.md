## About Hangman

This is a simple game of Hangman. It is my first project, after a month of studying Python.
The game is only text-based in the command line. It has simple functionality that can be expanded.
This was a project I could surprisingly comfortably pull ltogether with my current skills.
The rules are in the docstring of the file.
